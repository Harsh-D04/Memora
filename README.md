Persistent Memory Extension:
Memora is an AI memory extension system designed to overcome the short-term context limitations of standard chatbots. It enables chatbots to store, retrieve, and reuse relevant past interactions across conversations, creating more personalized and context-aware responses.

Context-Aware Information Retrieval:
The system intelligently retrieves only the most relevant historical information instead of replaying entire conversation logs, ensuring accurate responses while maintaining efficiency and reducing noise.

Improved Conversational Continuity:
By preserving important user preferences, facts, and previous discussion points, Memora allows AI chatbots to maintain long-term conversational continuity, making interactions feel more human and consistent.

Time & Interaction Efficiency:
Memora reduces repeated explanations and redundant user inputs by approximately 60%, significantly improving user experience and interaction efficiency.

Backend-Driven Modular Architecture:
Built with a scalable backend architecture, Memora handles memory storage, indexing, and retrieval independently of the chatbot logic, making it easy to integrate with different AI models or platforms.

Optimized for Performance & Scalability:
The system is designed to efficiently manage growing memory data while maintaining fast retrieval times, supporting long-running chatbot sessions and high interaction volumes.

Secure Data Handling:
User data and stored memory are handled securely using controlled access mechanisms, ensuring privacy and preventing unauthorized exposure.

Extensible for Advanced AI Workflows:
Memora can be extended to support features such as memory prioritization, decay mechanisms, user profiling, and analytics-driven memory optimization.
